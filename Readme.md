Consider this: N years M months ago, when you applied for your current job, you may not have known as much about the *practical* aspects of your work as you do now.

So, whether you're a seasoned engineer or just starting your journey, walking through the theoretical foundations and commonly asked questions related to your tech stack is a smart move. That's precisely what this repository is here for!
