**Q: The key differences between Scrum and Kanban**

Scrum
- Structure: Scrum is highly structured with defined roles (e.g., Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team) and ceremonies (e.g., Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Reviews, Retrospectives).
- Sprints: Work is divided into fixed-length iterations called sprints, usually lasting 2-4 weeks.
- Commitment: Teams commit to delivering a set of features by the end of each sprint.
- Flexibility: Changes are generally not made during a sprint; they are addressed in the next sprint.

Kanban
- Flow: Kanban focuses on continuous delivery and flow, without fixed-length iterations.
- Visual Management: Uses a Kanban board to visualize work items and their progress through various stages.
- Flexibility: More flexible in handling changes; work items can be added or reprioritized at any time.
- WIP Limits: Emphasizes limiting work in progress (WIP) to improve flow and reduce bottlenecks.

Summary
- Scrum is ideal for teams that benefit from structured processes and regular feedback cycles.
- Kanban is great for teams needing flexibility and continuous delivery.
